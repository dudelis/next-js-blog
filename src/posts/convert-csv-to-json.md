Hey there, fellow developers! Have you ever encountered the need to convert CSV text to JSON format within the Power Platform? It's a task that we often come across, and in this blog post, I'll walk you through a powerful solution that will save you time and effort. Let's dive in!

Standard Ways and Their Limitations:
When it comes to converting CSV to JSON, a mix of standard connectors within the Power Platform offer some functionality. However, relying solely on these connectors can lead to excessive API calls within your flow, which might not be ideal. Additionally, while there are third-party services available, they often come with an extra cost.

Introducing the Custom Connector Option:
Fortunately, there's a premium feature in the Power Platform that allows developers like us to take full control of the code and overcome the limitations of standard connectors. Enter the custom connector option! Although it comes with a price tag, the level of control it provides makes it a valuable tool for tackling complex conversion tasks.

Creating a Custom Connector - Step by Step:
  1. Start by navigating to the Power Platform and accessing the Power Apps Maker portal.
  2. From the left-hand navigation pane, select the "Data" tab, and then click on "Custom connectors."
  3. Click on "New custom connector" to begin the creation process.

  4. Give your custom connector a name and a suitable description, and choose an appropriate icon.
  5. In the "Security" tab, configure the authentication settings according to your requirements.
  6. Under the "Definition" tab, provide the necessary information, including the base URL and the actions required for CSV to JSON conversion.
  7. Test your custom connector to ensure it works as expected.
  8. Once everything is in place, save and publish your custom connector for use within the Power Platform.

Accessing Source Code and Additional Resources:
As promised, I've got something extra for you! If you're interested in exploring the source code or getting a deeper understanding of how the custom connector works, I've created a GitHub repository for you to access. You can find the repository [here](insert link to repository). Feel free to download the source code and adapt it to suit your needs.

Conclusion:
By leveraging the custom connector option within the Power Platform, we can convert CSV text to JSON format efficiently and without relying on excessive API calls or costly third-party services. I hope this step-by-step guide has helped you understand how to create a custom connector and given you the tools to tackle this task with ease. Happy coding!
